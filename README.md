## Efficient Signal Enhancement with Switch-Based Reconfigurable Antennas

These codes simulate the results of the paper in MATLAB. They include the following results:

### Real-valued channels based on Rayleigh fading model
These codes evaluate the results that are depicted in Fig.3, Table I, and Fig.4.

### Real-world complex channels based on ray-tracing model
These codes compare the performance of our proposed approach with MMSE, Analog beamforming, Analog beamforming + beamnulling, and TDMA + Analog beamforming under real-world complex channels. Specifically, these codes represent the results of Fig. 5, Fig. 6, and Fig. 7 in the paper. 

Note: In each folder, you need to run "Main_Running_File.m" to get the results.
