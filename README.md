## Power-Efficient Analog Front-End Interference Suppression with Binary Antennas

These codes simulate the results of the paper in MATLAB. They include the following results:

### Real-valued channels based on Rayleigh fading model
These codes evaluate the results that are depicted in Fig.3, Fig. 4, and Table IV.

### Complex-valued channels based on ray-tracing model
These codes represent the comparison results in Fig. 5 to compare the preformance of our method with latiice-based beamforming, WLLS, BIS, and digital beamforming. 

Note: In each folder, you need to run "Main_Running_File.m" to get the results.
